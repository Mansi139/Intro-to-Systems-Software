# EXIF-viewer

An EXIF	tag	is	embedded	in	many	image	files	taken	on	a	digital	camera	to	add	metadata	about	
the	 camera	and	exposure.	It	 is	a	 complicated	 format,	 but	we	 can	 simplify	 it	 to	where	we	 can	
write	a	simple	viewer	that	will	work	with	many	JPEG	files.

Make	a	program	called	exifview and	make	it	so	that	it	runs	with	the	following	command	line:
exifview FILENAME	

Run it as : 	./exifview img1.jpg
