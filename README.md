# Shared-Object-

A Shared Object is an executable file that acts as a shared library of functions. Dynamic linking provides a way for a process to call a function that is not part of its executable code. The executable code for the function is located in a .so file, which contains one or more functions that are compiled, linked, and stored separately from the processes that use them. Shared objects also facilitate the sharing of data and resources. Multiple applications can simultaneously access the contents of a single copy of a shared object in memory.

# EXIF-viewer

An EXIF	tag	is	embedded	in	many	image	files	taken	on	a	digital	camera	to	add	metadata	about	
the	 camera	and	exposure.	It	 is	a	 complicated	 format,	 but	we	 can	 simplify	 it	 to	where	we	 can	
write	a	simple	viewer	that	will	work	with	many	JPEG	files.

Make	a	program	called	exifview and	make	it	so	that	it	runs	with	the	following	command	line:
exifview FILENAME	

Run it as : 	./exifview img1.jpg
