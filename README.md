# Shared-Object-

A Shared Object is an executable file that acts as a shared library of functions. Dynamic linking provides a way for a process to call a function that is not part of its executable code. The executable code for the function is located in a .so file, which contains one or more functions that are compiled, linked, and stored separately from the processes that use them. Shared objects also facilitate the sharing of data and resources. Multiple applications can simultaneously access the contents of a single copy of a shared object in memory.
